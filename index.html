        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Where Do I Live</h2>
        <p>So before when I was born I lived in New Jersey after a couple of years the living conditions got worse and as such I had to move out along with my mother and father and we decided to go to college park next which was close to his work at the time. The living conditions there weren't good either so we moved out again and went to Maryland where me and my mother and father currently live</p>

        <h2>What Are Some Goals That I Have</h2>
        <p>I have many goals that I want to fulfill some being having a gpa that is 4.0 or higher and a sat score that is high enough to get enrolled into UMD since one of the jobs that I am thinking about doing is a software engineer since I heard that they get paid good amounts of money and reading the job description I think that it is something I am capable of doing. Another thing that I am interested in doing is travelling around the world and one of my goals is to travel to every continent across the world.</p>

        <h2>What Do I Do Outside Of School</h2>
        <p>Usaully when I don't have school I usaully head straight home and play videogames for a couple of hours. After that I usaully go on to school soccer practice or a game. Then I may do some homework or hang out with my family to complete my day.</p>
